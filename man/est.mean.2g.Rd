\value{
A list containing the estimated sample means for the two groups:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean.g1}: numeric value representing the estimated mean of group 1.
\item \code{mean.g2}: numeric value representing the estimated mean of group 2.
}
}
\description{
This function estimates the sample means from a two group study presenting quantile summary measures with the sample size (\eqn{n}).
The quantile summaries of each group can fall into one of the following categories:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{S_1}: \{ minimum, median, maximum \}
\item \eqn{S_2}: \{ first quartile, median, third quartile \}
\item \eqn{S_3}: \{ minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum \}
}

The \code{est.mean.2g} function uses a novel quantile-based distribution methods for estimating sample mean for two groups such as 'Treatment' and 'Control' (De Livera et al., 2024).
The method is based on the following quantile-based distributions for
estimating sample means:
\itemize{
\item Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD) for estimating sample means using
5-number summaries (\eqn{S_3}).
\item Skew Logistic Distribution (SLD) for estimating sample means using
3-number summaries (\eqn{S_1} and \eqn{S_2}).
}
}
\details{
The \code{est.mean.2g} function implement the methods proposed by De Livera et al. (2024) for the two group case by incorporating shared information across the two groups
to improve the accuracy of the  estimates.

The generalised lambda distribution (GLD) is a four parameter family of distributions defined by its quantile function under the FKML parameterisation (Freimer et al., 1988).
De Livera et al. propose that the GLD quantlie function can be used to approximate a sample's distribution using 5-point summaries (\eqn{S_3}).
The four parameters of GLD quantile function include: a location parameter (\eqn{\lambda_1}), an inverse scale parameter (\eqn{\lambda_2}>0), and two shape parameters (\eqn{\lambda_3} and \eqn{\lambda_4}).
The \code{est.mean.sld.2g} function considers the case where the underlying distribution in each group has
the same shape  (i.e., common \eqn{\lambda_3} and \eqn{\lambda_4}), and differ only in location and scale. Weights are used in the optimisation step in estimating
\eqn{\lambda_3} and \eqn{\lambda_4} to put more emphasis on the group with the larger sample size.

The quantile-based skew logistic distribution (SLD), introduced by Gilchrist (2000) and further modified by van Staden and King (2015)
is used to approximate the sample's distribution using 3-point summaries (\eqn{S_1} and \eqn{S_2}).
The SLD quantile function is defined using three parameters: a location parameter (\eqn{\lambda}), a scale parameter (\eqn{\eta}), and a skewing parameter (\eqn{\delta}).
In \code{est.mean.2g}, an assumption of a common skewing parameter (\eqn{\delta}) is used for the two groups, so a pooled estimate of \eqn{\delta} is computed using weights based on the sample sizes.

Under each scenario, the parameters of the respective distributions are estimated by formulating and solving a series of simultaneous equations which relate the estimated quantiles
with the population counterparts. The estimated mean is then obtained via integration of functions of the estimated quantile function.
