\description{
This function estimates the sample mean from a study presenting quantile summary measures with the sample size (\eqn{n}). The quantile summaries can fall into one of the following categories:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{S_1}: \{ minimum, median, maximum \}
\item \eqn{S_2}: \{ first quartile, median, third quartile \}
\item \eqn{S_3}: \{ minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum \}
}

The \code{est.mean} function implements newly proposed flexible quantile-based distribution methods for estimating sample mean (De Livera et al., 2024).
It also incorporates existing methods for estimating sample means as described by Luo et al. (2018) and McGrath et al. (2020).
}
\details{
The \code{'gld/sld'} method (i.e., the method of De Livera et al., (2024)) of \code{est.mean} uses the following quantile based distributions:
\itemize{
\item Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD) for estimating the sample mean using 5-number summaries (\eqn{S_3}).
\item Skew Logistic Distribution (SLD) for estimating the sample mean using 3-number summaries (\eqn{S_1} and \eqn{S_2}).
}
The generalised lambda distribution (GLD) is a four parameter family of distributions defined by its quantile function under the FKML parameterisation (Freimer et al., 1988).
De Livera et al. propose that the GLD quantlie function can be used to approximate a sample's distribution using 5-point summaries.
The four parameters of GLD quantile function include: a location parameter (\eqn{\lambda_1}), an inverse scale parameter (\eqn{\lambda_2}>0), and two shape parameters (\eqn{\lambda_3} and \eqn{\lambda_4}).

The quantile-based skew logistic distribution (SLD), introduced by Gilchrist (2000) and further modified by van Staden and King (2015)
is used to approximate the sample's distribution using 3-point summaries.
The SLD quantile function is defined using three parameters: a location parameter (\eqn{\lambda}), a scale parameter (\eqn{\eta}), and a skewing parameter (\eqn{\delta}).

For \code{'gld/sld'} method, the parameters of the generalized lambda distribution (GLD) and skew logistic distribution (SLD) are estimated
by formulating and solving a set of simultaneous equations. These equations relate the estimated sample quantiles to their theoretical counterparts
of the respective distribution (GLD or SLD). Finally, the mean for each scenario is calculated by integrating functions of the estimated quantile function.
